## How long did it take, and what would could be changed

I spent around five to six hours working on this challenge. If I had time I would add a way to allow the user to book a reservation when clicking on the card of the restaurant provided. There are reservation links provided for each restaurant. I would also refine the way I load data for user viewing, and spend more time on styling, to make it more cohesive, attractive, and responsive to varying devices. 

## Most recent & useful feature added to React
Spread operator:

```
const prepareStoreDataFromArray = (city, data) => {
   const allData = [].concat(...data);

   return prepareStoreData(city, allData);
};
```
## Tracking Performance issues

There were possible different reasons for performance issues. It can be a problem with data retrieval from database, or volume of retrieved information from the service, or redundant retrieval from api, or inefficient/unnecessary data processing on client’s side. On client’s side you do this with developer tools, or redux, react developer tools. On backend, you write logging, and check the performance of different data that are related to data operations. At one point I had to tune SQL queries on backend. 

## Improving the API

I would improve categories provided. There are a lot of information provided by open table that isn’t included, and could provide better filtering / more accurate results for whoever is using it. If it also understood GraphQL this would make it more efficient.
